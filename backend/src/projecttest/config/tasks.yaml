  description: >
    The candidate selected the following technology:
    {selected_tech}

    DECIDE FIRST if this technology can be evaluated using a
    programming exercise.

    If the technology is something like:
    cloud, devops, tooling, methodology, or anything
    that does not require writing code,
    respond EXACTLY with:
    "No coding challenge for this technology."
    If the chosen tech stack is a framework, generate a question 
    based on the core language.

    If the technology CAN be tested via programming:

    Create ONE LeetCode-style challenge.

    Difficulty rules:
    - Junior or Intermediate → EASY
    - Senior → MEDIUM

    Provide:
    - Clear problem statement
    - Function signature
    - Constraints
    - Example input/output

  expected_output: >
    Either:
    - "No coding challenge for this technology."
    OR
    - A full coding challenge.
